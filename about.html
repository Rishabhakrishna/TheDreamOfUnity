        <p id= 'rn07'>Greetings! My name is Rishabhakrishna Narendranath. It’s very long, I know! You can call me Rishabh for short. I am a fifteen year old living in the US, and I have a passion for sharing ideas and knowledge. I hope to provide education to every child on the planet one day, however I still have a long way to go before achieving so. 

The purpose of this blog is to simply spread my ideas and opinionated thoughts. I would like to emphasize that even if you agree with an article, you should do your own research after reading it. Think of these articles as gateways to unfamiliar topics; they should give you the key to the path of learning about the topic, not the only knowledge you will go by.

With that said, I would like to thank you again for taking the time to visit this blog, and I hope you enjoy what you find here!
